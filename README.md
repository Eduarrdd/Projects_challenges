This field is to up some challenges and projects about Python

## challenges

    1. rock_paper_scissors: This challenge was really interesting to me. I was able to use methods, conditionals and even more. Since I am still learning, I will modify it to optimize it. 

    2. Paises_mayores_y_menores_ventas: This challenge was really fascinating. I applied Pandas to get the 3 top and lowest sales countries applying a function that returns the total sales and then grouping and filtering the information to get the result. The dataset was got from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tunguz/online-retail?resource=download 




## Personal notes

I cannot imagine what I will achieve tomorrow. Honestly, I did not imagine I would create something like this yesterday and I cannot wait to see what we can achieve tomorrow. Without any doubt, wonderful things. I am sure of that.

It's just been a couple of weeks since I am fully applying the concepts and yes, I know more but I also does not know a lot. That is interesting. The things that I did not know yesterday, today I can apply them easily (but still with some issues). At the end, it has been a really interesting, amazing, and sometimes painful adventure.
